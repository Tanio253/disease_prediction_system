= Introduction
This report details the system design for an advanced AI-powered disease prediction application. The primary goal of this system is to accurately predict potential diseases an individual may encounter by leveraging comprehensive health data from disparate sources. This includes medical imagery (e.g., chest X-rays), tabular health history (e.g., NIH dataset information), and real-time sensor data.

The system is architected as a microservice-based application, promoting scalability, maintainability, and flexibility. It adheres to the technology stack recommendations, utilizing Python for backend and ML components, FastAPI for API development, PyTorch for model building, Gradio for the user interface, PostgreSQL for structured data storage, MinIO for object storage, and Docker for containerization and deployment.

This document provides an overview of the system architecture, details of each microservice, data management strategies, the machine learning pipeline, prediction workflow, and deployment considerations, and also the training strategies when dealing with missing modalities. The complexity and modularity of the solution aim to demonstrate a robust understanding of modern AI system development practices.
