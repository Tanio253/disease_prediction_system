= Conclusion
This report has outlined the design of a microservice-based AI system for disease prediction. The system integrates data from diverse sources (images, tabular NIH data, sensor readings), preprocesses this data into suitable features, and utilizes a multi-modal fusion model with an attention mechanism for prediction. The architecture emphasizes modularity, scalability, and adherence to the specified technology stack.

The implementation demonstrates a comprehensive approach, from data ingestion and preprocessing to model training, deployment, and user interaction via a Gradio frontend. While currently set up for local Docker Compose deployment, the containerized nature of the services provides a solid foundation for scaling and migration to cloud environments.

Key strengths of the system include its multi-modal data fusion capability which leverages an attention mechanism to weigh data sources, the robust microservice architecture facilitating independent development and scaling, and the end-to-end automated pipeline covering data management, model lifecycle, and prediction serving.

Future enhancements could include more sophisticated attention mechanisms within the fusion model, integration of additional data modalities (e.g., genomic data, clinical notes), advanced techniques for handling missing data, and a more comprehensive MLOps pipeline for continuous training, deployment, and monitoring in a production setting. The system also provides a strong base for further research into explainable AI (XAI) techniques to understand the model's predictions.
