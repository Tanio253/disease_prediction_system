= Deployment
The system is designed for containerized deployment using Docker. The `docker-compose.yml` file defines and orchestrates all the microservices, including the MinIO object store and PostgreSQL database.

- Each microservice has its own Dockerfile (e.g., `api_gateway/Dockerfile`, `data_ingestion_service/Dockerfile`, etc. These are defined in their respective service directories and referenced in the `docker-compose.yml`).
- Environment variables are used extensively for configuration (e.g., service URLs, MinIO credentials, database connection strings), managed through `.env` files and the `docker-compose.yml` environments section.
- Data persistence for MinIO and PostgreSQL is handled using Docker volumes (`minio_data`, `postgres_data`) as defined in `docker-compose.yml`.
- Health checks are defined in `docker-compose.yml` for MinIO and PostgreSQL to ensure they are ready before dependent services start.

To deploy the system locally:
1.  Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
2.  Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` if provided, or ensure variables are set.
3.  Build the Docker images for each service using `docker-compose build`.
4.  Start all services using `docker-compose up -d`.

For a production environment, more advanced orchestration tools like Kubernetes would be recommended, along with considerations for:
- *Scalability:* Replicating service instances based on load.
- *Monitoring & Logging:* Centralized logging (e.g., ELK stack) and monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
- *Security:* Enhanced network policies, secrets management, HTTPS termination.
- *CI/CD:* Automated build, test, and deployment pipelines.
- *Cloud Deployment:* The current setup with Docker allows for deployment to cloud platforms like AWS (ECS/EKS), Azure (AKS/ACI), or Google Cloud (GKE/Cloud Run) with appropriate adaptations for managed services (e.g., RDS for PostgreSQL, S3 for object storage).
